This quiz is designed to help you discover the perfect dog breed for your lifestyle and personality. Developed by [Sunne Dogcare](https://fridalannerstrom.github.io/dogsitter/), it reflects our belief that choosing a dog is one of the most important decisions a future dog owner can make. By understanding your needs, habits, and preferences, we hope to guide you toward a breed that will thrive in your care.

As a dog sitter, I see firsthand the consequences of impulsive dog purchases. Too often, people choose a breed based on looks, trends, or recommendations from friends without considering the breed‚Äôs unique characteristics and compatibility with their lifestyle. While I love caring for these dogs, I can‚Äôt help but wish that more owners had made informed decisions from the start.

This quiz is our way of promoting thoughtful dog ownership. By answering a series of fun and insightful questions, you‚Äôll gain a better understanding of which breed aligns with your daily life, ensuring a harmonious and happy relationship between you and your future furry friend.

# User Experience (UX)

## Purpose of the Quiz

This quiz has one simple goal: to help you discover which dog breed is the best match for your lifestyle and personality. There are no distractions, no unnecessary elements, and no clutter ‚Äî just a clean and straightforward experience. A clear CTA button invites users to start the quiz, with concise, engaging text to guide them.

While we provide a link back to Sunne Dogcare for those interested, this is not intended to act as an advertisement for the service. The focus remains solely on helping potential dog owners make thoughtful decisions about their future furry companions.

### Target Group:

- **Potential dog owners** - Individuals considering getting a dog but are unsure which breed suits their lifestyle and personality best.
- **First-Time dog owners** - People who have never owned a dog before and need guidance to make an informed decision.
- **Curious dog enthusiasts** - Dog lovers who may already have a dog but are curious about which other breeds might be a good match for them.

### How the quiz achieves its goal
We‚Äôve designed the quiz with simplicity and accessibility in mind, ensuring users can focus entirely on the task at hand. Here‚Äôs how:

| Feature | Description | 
| ------- | ----------- | 
| **Bright, Inviting Colors** | We use soft, natural tones to create a welcoming environment. | 
| **Illustrations of beautiful dogs** | Eye-catching visuals enhance the user experience and make the quiz enjoyable. |
| **Bold and clear text** | Short, simple instructions ensure users can easily follow along without confusion. | 
| **Straightforward Call-to-Action** | A single, prominent button directs users to start the quiz. |
| **Clear and simple questions** | Designed to be easy to understand, ensuring a smooth flow from start to finish. | 
| **Overview of top dog breed** | After completing the quiz, users are presented with their best match and receive clear, concise information about the breed. | 
| **Discover additional matches** | Users can also see their other top three potential breeds for broader insights and more options. | 


## Graphic Design & Color Scheme

The design of this quiz is intentionally simple, with a strong focus on text and illustrations. By avoiding distractions, the user can focus entirely on the content. The overall feel is warm, light, and trustworthy, brought to life through charming illustrations of various dog breeds.

### Color Scheme

- **Primary Colors:** Warm shades of brown set the tone for the quiz. Brown was chosen for its natural, earthy feel, evoking the outdoors, animals, and a connection to dogs. Many dogs are brown themselves, making this color both symbolic and relatable.
- **Neutral Accents:** Supporting neutral tones provide balance and ensure the content remains the primary focus without overwhelming the user.

Together, these colors create a natural and inviting atmosphere that aligns perfectly with the theme of dog ownership.

 ![Colors](assets/images/documentation/colors.png)

### Fonts

- **Headline Font (Caprasimo):** Large, bold, and eye-catching, this font is used for titles, questions, and results to immediately grab attention. Its slightly playful curves soften the boldness, adding a friendly yet professional tone.
- **Body Text Font (Poppins):** A clean and widely used sans-serif font, chosen for its excellent readability on all devices. It complements the boldness of Caprasimo, ensuring paragraphs and subheadings remain easy to read and visually appealing.

This pairing strikes the perfect balance, guiding the user‚Äôs eye naturally from headlines to supporting information.

 ![Fonts](assets/images/documentation/fonts.png)

### Headings, Buttons and Links

- **Caprasimo** for headings (H1, H2)
- **Poppins** for paragraphs and H3 (Poppins used instead of Caprasimo for H3 due to better readability).
- **Links** are styled in brown with an underline, maintaining a cohesive design that aligns with the overall aesthetic.
- **Buttons** are large and brown used consistently throughout the quiz. Their prominent size and simplicity make them stand out, ensuring users can easily interact with the quiz.

 ![Headings, text and buttons](assets/images/documentation/heading-text-buttons.png)

 ### Icons

A single type of icon, a paw print from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is used to provide visual information. For example, a breed‚Äôs energy level might be represented by five paw prints, with the number of filled paw prints indicating the level of activity. This simple visual system makes it quick and easy for users to interpret important information about each breed.

 ![Icons](assets/images/documentation/icons.png)

### Illustrations

Instead of photographs, the quiz features illustrations of various dog breeds. These illustrations, sourced from [Flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/) and created by [Maxim Kulikov](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/maxim-kulikov), bring a cohesive and playful touch to the design. The illustrations represent each breed accurately while maintaining an unified artistic style, enhancing the overall user experience.

## UI/UX Design

The focus of the UI/UX design process for this quiz was to create a versatile and intuitive interface that accommodates different types of questions and results. Since the exact wording of the quiz questions is still being refined at this point, the primary goal was to establish a design framework that supports various question formats. Each mockups also includes one or more selected options.

# Logic behind the quiz

The quiz consists of **14 questions** that can lead to one of **20 possible dog breeds**. Both the questions and the dog breeds are structured as objects in separate JavaScript files, which are imported into script.js. The JavaScript code is designed to be dynamic, meaning that if you add new dog breeds or questions, they will automatically be incorporated into the quiz form and included as potential results.

The selection of the 20 dog breeds was carefully curated to represent a broad range of sizes, behaviors, and needs. This variety ensures that the quiz provides meaningful and diverse results that can match different lifestyles and preferences. Each answer option contributes points to one or more dog breeds, with more points awarded if the answer aligns strongly with a breed‚Äôs characteristics and fewer points if it aligns less.

To organize the logic, I have used Notion to document the questions, calculations for matching breeds, and detailed information about the breeds themselves. The questions, information, and calculations are primarily based on my own experience as a dog sitter and my personal opinions on which dogs are best suited for different types of people and lifestyles. This hands-on knowledge was further complemented by ChatGPT, which helped refine questions and validate assumptions about how various breeds adapt to environments such as living with children, being alone often, or living in apartments.

This combination of practical experience and external input ensures that the quiz provides accurate, thoughtful, and personalized recommendations for potential dog owners.

## JavaScript changes

### Move dog data to seperate file

Initially, I had included all the dog breeds directly in the JavaScript file. However, as the number of breeds grew along with the amount of data, I decided to move the data to a separate file for better organization and maintainability.

### Move questions to seperate file

Initially, I had the questions and data points directly in the HTML. However, as the number of questions and breeds grew, it became increasingly difficult to manage them. Additionally, some answer options required descriptions or even images. To address this, I decided to move the questions to a separate file and generate the HTML quiz form dynamically using JavaScript.

| Before | After - seperate file | After - generate code | 
| ----- | ------- | ------- | 
| ![JS Before](assets/images/documentation/javascript-questions-before.png) | ![JS After](assets/images/documentation/javascript-questions.png) | ![JS After](assets/images/documentation/javascript-generate-questions.png) | 

## Future changes

There are, of course, many improvements that could be made, such as adding more dog breeds and creating more engaging, interactive questions. However, there is one particular part of the code that I‚Äôm not entirely satisfied with. It‚Äôs the section where the result is generated, and the correct elements are placed in the appropriate spots in the HTML. This code should be refactored into a loop using keys, rather than the current implementation.

### Bugs and result testing

| Bug       |  Description | Solution  |
| --------- | --------- | ---------- | 
| Dog breeds never showing up | I encountered an issue where small dogs appeared as results, even when I selected that I didn‚Äôt want small dogs. | To solve this, I assigned very high points to the size preference chosen by the user, ensuring it outweighs all other factors. Similarly, for breeds that should be excluded based on certain answers, like a beginner being matched with a German Shepherd, I assigned very low scores (e.g., -100) to push those breeds to the bottom of the ranking. | 
| Balancing Dog Breeds in the Quiz | Some dog breeds, like Border Collie or Boxer, rarely appear as results during testing, even though they should. | To address this, I reviewed and adjusted the scoring system to ensure all breeds have a fair chance of being matched based on user preferences and quiz answers. However, this still needs more work. | 


### Unfixed Bugs

None that I know of - feel free to tell me if you find any!
