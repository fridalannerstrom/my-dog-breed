# Welcome to "Find your ideal dog breed" Quiz!
This quiz is designed to help you discover the perfect dog breed for your lifestyle and personality. Developed by [Sunne Dogcare](https://fridalannerstrom.github.io/dogsitter/), it reflects our belief that choosing a dog is one of the most important decisions a future dog owner can make. By understanding your needs, habits, and preferences, we hope to guide you toward a breed that will thrive in your care.

As a dog sitter, I see firsthand the consequences of impulsive dog purchases. Too often, people choose a breed based on looks, trends, or recommendations from friends without considering the breed‚Äôs unique characteristics and compatibility with their lifestyle. While I love caring for these dogs, I can‚Äôt help but wish that more owners had made informed decisions from the start.

This quiz is our way of promoting thoughtful dog ownership. By answering a series of fun and insightful questions, you‚Äôll gain a better understanding of which breed aligns with your daily life, ensuring a harmonious and happy relationship between you and your future furry friend.

# User Experience (UX)

## Purpose of the Quiz

This quiz has one simple goal: to help you discover which dog breed is the best match for your lifestyle and personality. There are no distractions, no unnecessary elements, and no clutter ‚Äî just a clean and straightforward experience. A single clear button invites users to start the quiz, with concise, engaging text to guide them.

While we provide a link back to Sunne Dogcare for those interested, this is not intended to act as an advertisement for the service. The focus remains solely on helping potential dog owners make thoughtful decisions about their future furry companions.

### Target Group:

- **Potential dog owners** - Individuals considering getting a dog but are unsure which breed suits their lifestyle and personality best.
- **First-Time dog owners** - People who have never owned a dog before and need guidance to make an informed decision.
- **Curious dog enthusiasts** - Dog lovers who may already have a dog but are curious about which other breeds might be a good match for them.

### How the quiz achieves its goal
We‚Äôve designed the quiz with simplicity and accessibility in mind, ensuring users can focus entirely on the task at hand. Here‚Äôs how:

| Feature | Description | 
| ------- | ----------- | 
| **Bright, Inviting Colors** | We use soft, natural tones to create a welcoming environment. | 
| **Illustrations of beautiful dogs** | Eye-catching visuals enhance the user experience and make the quiz enjoyable. |
| **Bold and clear text** | Short, simple instructions ensure users can easily follow along without confusion. | 
| **Straightforward Call-to-Action** | A single, prominent button directs users to start the quiz. |
| **Clear and Simple Questions** | Designed to be easy to understand, ensuring a smooth flow from start to finish. | 
| **Overview of Top Dog Breed** | After completing the quiz, users are presented with their best match and receive clear, concise information about the breed. | 
| **Discover Additional Matches** | Users can also see their other top three potential breeds for broader insights and more options. | 


## Graphic Design & Color Scheme

The design of this quiz is intentionally simple, with a strong focus on text and illustrations. By avoiding distractions, the user can focus entirely on the content. The overall feel is warm, light, fresh, and trustworthy, brought to life through charming illustrations of various dog breeds.

### Color Scheme

- **Primary Colors:** Warm shades of brown set the tone for the quiz. Brown was chosen for its natural, earthy feel, evoking the outdoors, animals, and a connection to dogs. Many dogs are brown themselves, making this color both symbolic and relatable.
- **Neutral Accents:** Supporting neutral tones provide balance and ensure the content remains the primary focus without overwhelming the user.

Together, these colors create a natural and inviting atmosphere that aligns perfectly with the theme of dog ownership.

 ![Colors](assets/images/documentation/colors.png)

### Fonts

- **Headline Font (Caprasimo):** Large, bold, and eye-catching, this font is used for titles, questions, and results to immediately grab attention. Its slightly playful curves soften the boldness, adding a friendly yet professional tone.
- **Body Text Font (Poppins):** A clean and widely used sans-serif font, chosen for its excellent readability on all devices. It complements the boldness of Caprasimo, ensuring paragraphs and subheadings remain easy to read and visually appealing.

This pairing strikes the perfect balance, guiding the user‚Äôs eye naturally from headlines to supporting information.

 ![Fonts](assets/images/documentation/fonts.png)

### Headings, Buttons and Links

- **Caprasimo** for headings (H1, H2)
- **Poppins** for paragraphs and H3 (Poppins used instead of Caprasimo for H3 due to better readability).
- **Links** are styled in brown with an underline, maintaining a cohesive design that aligns with the overall aesthetic.
- **Buttons** Large and brown buttons are used consistently throughout the quiz. Their prominent size and simplicity make them stand out, ensuring users can easily interact with the quiz.

 ![Headings, text and buttons](assets/images/documentation/heading-text-buttons.png)

 ### Icons

A single type of icon, a paw print from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is used to provide visual cues. For example, a breed‚Äôs energy level might be represented by five paw prints, with the number of filled paw prints indicating the level of activity. This simple visual system makes it quick and easy for users to interpret important information about each breed.

 ![Icons](assets/images/documentation/icons.png)

### Illustrations

Instead of photographs, the quiz features illustrations of various dog breeds. These illustrations, sourced from [Flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/) and created by [Maxim Kulikov](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/maxim-kulikov), bring a cohesive and playful touch to the design. The illustrations represent each breed accurately while maintaining a unified artistic style, enhancing the overall user experience.

## UI/UX Design

The focus of the UI/UX design process for this quiz was to create a versatile and intuitive interface that accommodates different types of questions and results. Since the exact wording of the quiz questions is still being refined, the primary goal was to establish a design framework that supports various question formats. This includes:

| Purpose | Description | üñ•Ô∏è Desktop | üíª Tablet | üì± Mobile |
| ------- | ----------- | ------- | ------ | ------ |
| **Checkbox questions** | For questions where users can select multiple answers. | ![Index Layout](assets/images/documentation/homepage.png) | ![Index Layout](assets/images/documentation/homepage.png) | ![Index Layout](assets/images/documentation/homepage.png) |

In addition to the question layouts, the quiz consists of three main page elements. Each page is designed for clarity and usability, ensuring a seamless experience. Below is an overview of their purpose:

| Purpose | Description | üñ•Ô∏è Desktop | üíª Tablet | üì± Mobile |
| ------- | ----------- | ------- | ------ | ------ |
| **Intro page** | Landing page with a clear CTA to start the quiz. | ![Index Layout](assets/images/documentation/homepage.png) | ![Index Layout](assets/images/documentation/homepage.png) | ![Index Layout](assets/images/documentation/homepage.png) | 
| **Result page** | Displays the best match, additional breeds, and key details. | ![Index Layout](assets/images/documentation/homepage.png) | ![Index Layout](assets/images/documentation/homepage.png) | ![Index Layout](assets/images/documentation/homepage.png) |

The final design for the UI were created using [Adobe XD](https://adobexdplatform.com/). The overall goal was to create a clean, engaging, and accessible design that guides users seamlessly through the quiz while keeping the experience visually appealing and user-friendly. This structure ensures flexibility for adjustments as the content evolves, without compromising the design's functionality or aesthetics.

## Feature Changes

Throughout the development process, changes were made to the design, content, sections, and features to enhance usability and clarity. These adjustments were necessary to ensure a better user experience. The changes are listed below.

‚ö†Ô∏è Some images on the live site differ from those in the mockup. These changes were made based on personal preference during the development process, as I felt the new images were a better fit. The specific image changes are not listed below.

| Action | Section | Reason | Before | After |
| ------ | ------- | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| **üóëÔ∏èRemoval** | Contact form | Having two contact forms was unnecessary and caused confusion. The contact form was removed and replaced with a CTA box. Now, only one form remains: the booking form. | ![Old Contact Form](assets/images/documentation/contact-form.png) | ![CTA-box](assets/images/documentation/cta-section.png) | 
| **‚Äçüé®Design Change** | Service Page | The service section felt cluttered with too many boxes. The large yellow box was removed, and instead, individual boxes were used for the list, resulting in a cleaner and lighter design. On desktop, a thin grey border was added to better separate the different sections. | ![Old Services](assets/images/documentation/services-old.png) | ![New Services](assets/images/documentation/services-page-desktop.png) | 
| **üóëÔ∏èRemoval** | Service Button | Having a separate CTA button for booking each service was unnecessary, as the same booking form applies to all services. | ![Old Services Button](assets/images/documentation/services-old.png) | ![New Services Button](assets/images/documentation/services-page-desktop.png) | 
| **‚úÖAddition** | List | The section about the dog sitter felt dull with only paragraph text. A list was added to clearly highlight the sitter's experience, making the information more engaging and easier to absorb. | ![Old About](assets/images/documentation/old-about-dogsitter.png) | ![New About](assets/images/documentation/about-dogsitter-desktop.png) | 
| **‚Äçüé®Design Change** | Gallery | The original plan was to display two columns for gallery on the homepage for mobile devices. However, the images appeared too small, so I adjusted the layout to a single-column. | ![Old Gallery](assets/images/documentation/gallery-mockup.png) | ![New Gallery](assets/images/documentation/gallery-live.png) | 
| **‚úÖAddition** | Contact | Realized that adding contact information to the contact page was essential, of course. | ![Old Booking](assets/images/documentation/booking-without-contact.png) | ![New Booking](assets/images/documentation/booking-with-contact.png) | 
| **‚Äçüé®Design Change** | Navigation | Navigation dropdown changed fron left aligned text to right aligned text for easier thumb use on mobile | ![Old Navigation](assets/images/documentation/navigation-mockup.png) | ![New Navigation](assets/images/documentation/navigation-dropdown.png) | 
| **‚úÖAddition** | Gallery | Added a link to see more images below the gallery on homepage | ![Old Gallery](assets/images/documentation/gallery-mockup.png) | ![New Gallery](assets/images/documentation/gallery-live.png) | 

## Future Features
Here are some ideas for expanding the website in future development phases. 

1. **Booking calendar:** Implement a calendar system to allow users to select dates and times more intuitively, while also viewing availability. For example, fully booked days could be marked in red and nearly full days in orange. Additionally, a feature to search for availability on specific dates would enhance the booking process.

2. **Review system:** Introduce a review system where dog owners can leave feedback after using the service. This could include star ratings and written reviews displayed on the website. An automated email could be sent to clients after they pick up their dog, encouraging them to submit a review.

3. **Live chat/Customer support:** Add a chat feature or support system, allowing users to ask quick questions or get in touch directly from the website, ensuring faster communication and customer service.

4. **Owner updates and reports:** Develop a system for sending updates, pictures, and reports directly to dog owners. This would allow tracking of activities like walks and feeding, keeping owners informed about their dog‚Äôs care in real-time.

5. **Online payment integration:** Enable users to complete payments directly through the website during the booking process, offering a seamless and convenient checkout experience.

6. **Booking calendar for new clients:** Allowing new clients to schedule an initial one-hour meeting. This meeting gives new dog owners the chance to meet me, interact with my dogs, and get a sense of how the service operates.

I tested all available screen sizes in Google Developer Tools, and the website displays correctly across all devices.

### Pagespeed Insights

There are some performance issues across all pages, some of them are due to the large size of images. Future development of the site should focus on optimizing images for the web.

Found by testing site in [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/). | Changed the tag‚Äôs background color to a darker green. | 
| Contrast Issue | ![Contrast in CTA box](assets/images/documentation/background-issue.png) | Low contrast between white text and image background when testing site in [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/). | Applied a dark overlay with CSS instead of manually darkening the background in Photoshop, improving text visibility and accessibility. | 
| Responsive Issue | ![Form bugg on small screens](assets/images/documentation/booking-form-small-screen.png) | The booking form displayed incorrectly on smaller screens, losing padding and causing a horizontal scroll due to oversized input fields. | Added responsive CSS for smaller screens, reducing padding and font size for form inputs. Also adjusted padding on the form container for better layout on mobile devices. | 
| Responsive Issue | ![CTA bugg on small screens](assets/images/documentation/button-bugg.png) | The CTA button was getting cut off on smaller screens, resulting in awkward line breaks and poor user experience. | Reduced the button size and adjusted padding within the CTA box for smaller screens to prevent the cutoff and ensure proper alignment. | 
| Responsive Issue | ![Overflow issue on small screens](assets/images/documentation/footer-bugg.png) | On screens smaller than 350px, the body content shrank, but an overflow issue caused the content to not align properly on the right side. | Identified the footer logo as the cause. Applied a max-width and width:100% to correct this. |
