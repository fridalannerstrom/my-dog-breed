![Logotype](assets/images/documentation/logotype.png)

[Sunne Dogcare](https://fridalannerstrom.github.io/dogsitter/) is a website created for my growing dog-sitting service in Sunne, Sweden. As the demand for dog-sitting has continued to increase, I decided to turn my passion into a business, and this project was the perfect opportunity to get started on a website for my dog care service.

The goal of the site is to provide potential clients with an easy way to explore the services I offer, get to know me and my dogs, and contact me directly for bookings or questions. I wanted the website to reflect the personal touch I bring to my business, so I chose photos and a warm, inviting design to make dog owners feel comfortable and confident when they leave their pets in my care.

Sunne Dogcare is presented with a modern yet friendly aesthetic, focusing on trust and reliability, while also making sure all necessary information is easily accessible and understood.

## Wireframes
Wireframes were created using [Adobe XD](https://adobexdplatform.com/), with a strong focus on the user goals, business goals, and user stories. These wireframes serve as the foundation for the design and structure of the website.

## Graphic Design & Color Scheme
The design, fonts, and media are all focused on creating a warm, trustworthy feel that reflects nature and the calm of the surrounding forest. The goal is to make the user feel secure and confident in the services, while keeping things professional. At the same time, the design ensures that the message is clear and easy to take in quickly, so users can find what they need without any hassle.

### Colors

- **Primary Color:** The design primarily uses three shades of green as the main color. Green was chosen for its strong association with nature, conveying a sense of calm and reliability ‚Äîq ualities that align well with the values of a dog-sitting service in a rural setting. Additionally, green represents safety and harmony, which are qualities that Sunne Dogcare wants to convey to its users.
- **Secondary Color:** A warm, light color is used as the secondary color to add warmth to the design. This shade leans towards orange, a color often linked with happiness and positivity, which complements the joyful and caring atmosphere of the business.
- **Base Colors:** Black and white are employed as the base colors. Black adds contrast and elegance, helping to ground the design and highlight key elements, while white brings clarity and simplicity, ensuring that the overall message is clear and easy to read. 

Together, these colors create a balanced and professional look, enhancing the user experience without overwhelming the content.

 ![Colors](assets/images/documentation/colors.png)

### Fonts

#### Fonts choosen
- **Lora** for headings ‚Äì a serif font that conveys a professional and trustworthy impression, adding a sense of seriousness and reliability to the site. 
- **Work Sans** for paragraph text ‚Äì a basic and modern sans-serif font chosen for its readability, particularly on screens and smaller devices.

By combining a serif and a sans-serif font, the design achieves a balanced look that feels both professional and approachable, as well as inviting and personal. These two fonts complement each other well, enhancing the overall user experience.

#### Fonts styling

- **Lora** for headings (H1, H2)
- **Work Sans** for paragraphs and H3 (Work Sans used instead of Lora for H3 due to better readability).
- **Highlighted text** is Work Sans in bold green
- **Topic Tag**, to help users quickly identify content, has a green background and light, uppercase text in Work Sans.
- **Links** are underlined in green with arrow icon.
- **CTA Buttons** come in two styles: Light, with white background and black text, and Dark, with green background and white text. Both light and dark have the same hover style.

 ![Fonts](assets/images/documentation/fonts.png)

 ![Headings, text and buttons](assets/images/documentation/heading-text-buttons.png)

### Logotype
The logo for Sunne Dogcare uses the font [Hot Mess by Sam Parrett](https://www.behance.net/gallery/79231099/Hot-Mess-SVG-Font). This slightly messy, handwritten font was chosen to create a contrast with the otherwise clean and polished design of the brand. The playful, informal style of the font reflects the more unpredictable and sometimes chaotic nature of dog-sitting, making it a fitting choice for the brand.

 ![Logotype](assets/images/documentation/logotype.png)

### Icons

The icons used throughout the design are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) in the bold solid style. Icons are an important part of the branding, as they help convey messages in a simpler and more visual way. The icons chosen are closely associated with dogs and nature, such as a bone, paw print, and forest.

 ![Icons](assets/images/documentation/icons.png)

### Media

The images used on the site will focus on dogs highlighting themes of nature, forest, warmth, and joy. The photos will predominantly feature green and natural bright tones to align with the overall design, avoiding sharp or overly bright colors. Warm, earthy hues will be prioritized to create a welcoming and soothing atmosphere, reinforcing the connection to the countryside and the caring environment that Sunne Dogcare offers. All images will have rounded borders to create a softer and more welcoming feel.

The images are sourced from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) via an Unsplash+ subscription.

Additionally, some background images are used with a subtle green overlay.

 ![Background with overlay](assets/images/documentation/green-background.png)

## UI/UX Design

The final mockups for the UI were created using [Adobe XD](https://adobexdplatform.com/). The design focuses on a clean and light aesthetic with a clear information hierarchy. Call-to-Actions (CTAs) are designed to be noticeable, encouraging interaction. The overall design aims to provide an intuitive and positive experience for the users.

## Feature Changes

Throughout the development process, changes were made to the design, content, sections, and features to enhance usability and clarity. These adjustments were necessary to ensure a better user experience. The changes are listed below.

‚ö†Ô∏è Some images on the live site differ from those in the mockup. These changes were made based on personal preference during the development process, as I felt the new images were a better fit. The specific image changes are not listed below.

| Action | Section | Reason | Before | After |
| ------ | ------- | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| **üóëÔ∏èRemoval** | Contact form | Having two contact forms was unnecessary and caused confusion. The contact form was removed and replaced with a CTA box. Now, only one form remains: the booking form. | ![Old Contact Form](assets/images/documentation/contact-form.png) | ![CTA-box](assets/images/documentation/cta-section.png) | 
| **‚Äçüé®Design Change** | Service Page | The service section felt cluttered with too many boxes. The large yellow box was removed, and instead, individual boxes were used for the list, resulting in a cleaner and lighter design. On desktop, a thin grey border was added to better separate the different sections. | ![Old Services](assets/images/documentation/services-old.png) | ![New Services](assets/images/documentation/services-page-desktop.png) | 
| **üóëÔ∏èRemoval** | Service Button | Having a separate CTA button for booking each service was unnecessary, as the same booking form applies to all services. | ![Old Services Button](assets/images/documentation/services-old.png) | ![New Services Button](assets/images/documentation/services-page-desktop.png) | 
| **‚úÖAddition** | List | The section about the dog sitter felt dull with only paragraph text. A list was added to clearly highlight the sitter's experience, making the information more engaging and easier to absorb. | ![Old About](assets/images/documentation/old-about-dogsitter.png) | ![New About](assets/images/documentation/about-dogsitter-desktop.png) | 
| **‚Äçüé®Design Change** | Gallery | The original plan was to display two columns for gallery on the homepage for mobile devices. However, the images appeared too small, so I adjusted the layout to a single-column. | ![Old Gallery](assets/images/documentation/gallery-mockup.png) | ![New Gallery](assets/images/documentation/gallery-live.png) | 
| **‚úÖAddition** | Contact | Realized that adding contact information to the contact page was essential, of course. | ![Old Booking](assets/images/documentation/booking-without-contact.png) | ![New Booking](assets/images/documentation/booking-with-contact.png) | 
| **‚Äçüé®Design Change** | Navigation | Navigation dropdown changed fron left aligned text to right aligned text for easier thumb use on mobile | ![Old Navigation](assets/images/documentation/navigation-mockup.png) | ![New Navigation](assets/images/documentation/navigation-dropdown.png) | 
| **‚úÖAddition** | Gallery | Added a link to see more images below the gallery on homepage | ![Old Gallery](assets/images/documentation/gallery-mockup.png) | ![New Gallery](assets/images/documentation/gallery-live.png) | 

## Future Features
Here are some ideas for expanding the website in future development phases. 

1. **Booking calendar:** Implement a calendar system to allow users to select dates and times more intuitively, while also viewing availability. For example, fully booked days could be marked in red and nearly full days in orange. Additionally, a feature to search for availability on specific dates would enhance the booking process.

2. **Review system:** Introduce a review system where dog owners can leave feedback after using the service. This could include star ratings and written reviews displayed on the website. An automated email could be sent to clients after they pick up their dog, encouraging them to submit a review.

3. **Live chat/Customer support:** Add a chat feature or support system, allowing users to ask quick questions or get in touch directly from the website, ensuring faster communication and customer service.

4. **Owner updates and reports:** Develop a system for sending updates, pictures, and reports directly to dog owners. This would allow tracking of activities like walks and feeding, keeping owners informed about their dog‚Äôs care in real-time.

5. **Online payment integration:** Enable users to complete payments directly through the website during the booking process, offering a seamless and convenient checkout experience.

6. **Booking calendar for new clients:** Allowing new clients to schedule an initial one-hour meeting. This meeting gives new dog owners the chance to meet me, interact with my dogs, and get a sense of how the service operates.

### Responsiveness

Throughout the project, I prioritized responsive design by continuously testing with Google Developer Tools. Each new feature was tested on both small and large screen sizes to ensure optimal performance. I followed a mobile-first approach, carefully considering both extra-large and extra-small screens. I tested all available screen sizes in Google Developer Tools, and the website displays correctly across all devices.

### Pagespeed Insights

There are some performance issues across all pages, some of them are due to the large size of images. Future development of the site should focus on optimizing images for the web.

### Bugs

| Bug       | Screenshot | Description | Solution  |
| --------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- | 
| Contrast Issue | ![Contrast in navigation](assets/images/documentation/low-contrast.png) | Low contrast on the active navigation link in the header resulted in poor accessibility. Found by testing site in [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/). | Improved accessibility by changing the active link color to a darker green and adding an underline. | 
| Contrast Issue | ![Contrast in topic tag](assets/images/documentation/contrast-issue-2.png) | Low contrast on the topic tag caused poor accessibility, making the text hard to read, especially for users with visual impairments. Found by testing site in [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/). | Changed the tag‚Äôs background color to a darker green. | 
| Contrast Issue | ![Contrast in CTA box](assets/images/documentation/background-issue.png) | Low contrast between white text and image background when testing site in [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/). | Applied a dark overlay with CSS instead of manually darkening the background in Photoshop, improving text visibility and accessibility. | 
| Responsive Issue | ![Form bugg on small screens](assets/images/documentation/booking-form-small-screen.png) | The booking form displayed incorrectly on smaller screens, losing padding and causing a horizontal scroll due to oversized input fields. | Added responsive CSS for smaller screens, reducing padding and font size for form inputs. Also adjusted padding on the form container for better layout on mobile devices. | 
| Responsive Issue | ![CTA bugg on small screens](assets/images/documentation/button-bugg.png) | The CTA button was getting cut off on smaller screens, resulting in awkward line breaks and poor user experience. | Reduced the button size and adjusted padding within the CTA box for smaller screens to prevent the cutoff and ensure proper alignment. | 
| Responsive Issue | ![Overflow issue on small screens](assets/images/documentation/footer-bugg.png) | On screens smaller than 350px, the body content shrank, but an overflow issue caused the content to not align properly on the right side. | Identified the footer logo as the cause. Applied a max-width and width:100% to correct this. | 

### Goal testing

| **Business Goals:** Enable easy booking | ‚úÖ Pass | Booking form with easy navigation and easy to fill out form |
| **Attract new customers** Attract new customers | ‚ö†Ô∏è Almost Pass | The website does attract new customers, but the content could be more directly aimed at new customers than it currently is, with special offer or something like that |
